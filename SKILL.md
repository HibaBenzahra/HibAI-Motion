Built in code from a real clip plus a person cut-out, in the user's own colours, fonts, name and handle (neutral defaults otherwise).

# HibAI Motions 💚 by Hiba (@hibssssi)

16 motion effects made from **your own clip**: your face and voice stay real, everything around you is drawn in code, frame by frame. No stock images, no editing app.

**First message of the session**, in the user's language (Darija by default):
> مرحبا بيك ف **HibAI Motions** 💚 صيفط ليا الـ clip ديالك و قول ليا شنو هوما الـ effects اللي بغيتي.

## The 16 effects (keys are fixed)

| key | what happens |
|---|---|
| `orbit` | thumbnails of your clips circle your head, back ones pass behind you; small caption + a big accent word |
| `couch_wall` | three columns of your clips rise behind you; small line + huge word |
| `ui_world` | a chat window with your brand name: your raw clips fly in, `/video-edit` gets typed; your clip below with a caption |
| `frame_break` | the shot shrinks into a reel post (your handle + avatar) and you stay big in front of it |
| `digital_zoom` | small caption, then a hard punch-in with a flash and a big two-word caption |
| `phone_mockup` | a phone (drawn in code) slides in: an AI assistant proposes a fix, a finger taps Approve |
| `checklist` | glass panel "ALL YOU NEED TO DO": steps type in and tick |
| `headline_wall` | camera shake, then headlines, chat bubbles and posts slap onto the wall behind you |
| `zoom_through_cut` | radial zoom into your face, through black, out into a second shot |
| `chart_grow` | a weekday chart behind you, the line takes off, a SCALE pill pops |
| `pull_back_reveal` | the shot pulls back into an editor window: checklist ticks, waveform fills, frame counter |
| `green_screen` | your background becomes a focus-timer page; caption words light up |
| `paper_cut` | paper collage: scribbles, torn yellow strip, stamped "100%", you as a paper sticker |
| `doodle_boil` | a boiling white outline around you, a doodle heart, a clapperboard that draws itself |
| `cover_story` | a giant masthead word rises behind your head |
| `glass_type` | a glass word standing in perspective behind you, with a light sweep |

## Setup (once)
- ffmpeg, Google Chrome, Python 3, Node.
- `pip install "rembg[cpu]" pillow` (the person cut-out).
- In this skill folder: `npm i puppeteer-core`.

## Workflow
1. **Pick the moments.** For each effect choose 1.8 s where the user talks with their hands, eyes open, face roughly centred. Different outfits or places per card look best.
2. **Write `<project>/motions.json`** (cards in the order they will be shown):
   ```json
   {"theme": {"brand": "YourBrand", "accent": "#FF7A00", "handle": "yourname", "fontAr": "fonts/ar.ttf", "fontEn": "fonts/en.ttf", "avatar": "me.jpg"},
    "cards": [{"effect": "orbit", "src": "clip.mp4", "t": 12.3, "words": ["كنهضر", "مع", "Claude"]},
              {"effect": "glass_type", "src": "clip.mp4", "t": 4.0, "words": ["HIBAI"]}]}
   ```
   - `theme`: **the user's own** brand name, accent colour, handle, avatar and fonts (paths relative to the project). Always ask for them.
     Never reuse another creator's brand (colours, fonts, handle) as a default. Missing values fall back to the neutral look:
     soft lime `#E6F07C`, Inter (Latin) + Almarai (Arabic) from Google Fonts, generic labels ("AI assistant", "Studio", "made with AI").
   - `words`: what they say in that moment (transcribe the 1.8 s with whisper). Captions show 1 to 3 of them. `cover_story` and `glass_type` use `words[0]` as the big word (defaults: EDIT, STUDIO).
   - `zoom_through_cut` cuts into the next card's clip, or set `"second": <card index>`.
3. **Prepare:** `python scripts/prepare.py <project>` → frames, cut-outs, 12 thumbnails from their clips.
4. **Preview:** `node scripts/render.js <project> preview` → 3 stills per card in `<project>/prev/`. Check: face covered? caption over the mouth? cut-out edges? Fix before rendering.
5. **Render:** `node scripts/render.js <project> all` → `<project>/fx/01.mp4 …` (1.8 s each, silent). Add `orbit glass_type …` to render only some.

## Rules
- Their face, voice and clips only. Interfaces in the effects are drawn in code and carry the user's brand name (or neutral labels), no third-party logos or stock images.
- Captions in the speaker's own words, 1 to 3 words on screen, no boxes behind caption words.
- To combine cards into one reel (prompt → result, side by side, list reel), build it on top of these MP4s (for example with a video-editing skill).
